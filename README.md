# JavaScript Null Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving null value handling and provides a solution.  The `bug.js` file contains code that demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

The original code incorrectly handles `null` inputs, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.  The solution adds explicit checks for `null` to prevent these problems.
